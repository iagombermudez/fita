# Fitapp (frontend)

This project corresponds to a prototype of a fitness social network application. The goal of this app is for trainers and users to be able to create, share and like different workouts. 
This app is written using Typescript and React for the front-end, and .Net Core for the backend. The backend code is stored in a different respository at the moment
